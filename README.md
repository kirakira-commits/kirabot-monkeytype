# kirabot-monkeytype
Very unadvanced cheating tool for monkeytype.com (note that it may work on other websites [change l34:self.driver.get('''https://yourwebsite'''), BUT the HTML structure has to be sufficiently enough to let the program find the word address.) Credits to https://github.com/CuriousAvenger/MonkeyType-Bot for an example
