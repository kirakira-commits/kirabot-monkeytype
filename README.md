# kirabot-monkeytype
Very unadvanced cheating tool for monkeytype.com (note that it may work on other websites [change l34:self.driver.get('''https://yourwebsite.com'''), BUT the HTML structure has to be sufficiently enough to let the program find the word address.) Credits to [here](https://github.com/CuriousAvenger/MonkeyType-Bot) for an example.

## Tutorial
### How to use:
First of all your Chrome™ version **must** be lower than 115 (selenium breaks on higher versions). Chromium not supported because of webdriver issues that I don't want to die trying to fix. Download links can be found in the Downloads section below. You will obviously need python, which I won't link here.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirakira-commits/kirabot-monkeytype.git
cd <dir (e.g. ~/Downloads/kirabot/)>
python3 -m pip install -r requirements
python3 kirabot.py
```

## Warnings (again)

> [!TIP]
> You can fork this repo and try to make one for [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) because Typeracer doesn't have much anticheat either, until you get 200+ wpm.
